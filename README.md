# Scrapers

General web scrapers I have made to collect and investigate data I am interested in

## Crossfit Games
Downloads data for the 2018 crossfit games from the API endpoint and writes it to a pickled DataFrame for further parsing.

As the data comes in the same JSON format as is used for the leaderboard website, all of this data should be correct. I am currently working on a script to parse this data into regularised tables.
